# library-management-system

**Description:** In this project we created a system for library management. User can add students and books in library and can perform several operations on students as well as books list in the library. Then we created a system where user can issue/return a book to the library when he entered valid details. This whole system was created using the concepts of linked list and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in **C++**.
